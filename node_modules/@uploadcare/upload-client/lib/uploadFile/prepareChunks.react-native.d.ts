 * React-native hack for blob slicing
 *
 * We need to store references to sliced blobs to prevent source blob from
 * being deallocated until uploading complete. Access to deallocated blob
 * causes app crash.
 *
 * See https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-upload-client/issues/306
 * and https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/27543
